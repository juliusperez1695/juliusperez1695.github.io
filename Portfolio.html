                    Julius Perez is a native of San Diego, CA. In June of 2020, he earned his Bachelor of Science in Electrical 
                    Engineering at the University of California, San Diego. There he developed his knowledge in calculus-based physics and 
                    microelectronics theory, and specialized in optics and laser theory. Along with various senior projects involving 
                    the use of popular industry tools such as MatLab, Solidworks and LabView, Perez was also fortunate to apply his 
                    skills in a research internship with Clemson Universityâ€™s Photonics department. He now works as an Electrical 
                    Engineer at HRL Laboratories in Malibu, CA focusing on DC and RF testing of semiconductor devices while
                    he also pursues his Master of Science degree in Computer Science.
